its just uses array and objects like json, where memory can be saved by not saving duplicate values.
the concept is like the main structure will be in key value pair, and key will be a unique number which act as a base address.
then in value the data is stored in array as character by character and for where is gets 
completed it have a uniqueid at start and have value where it starts with _. it use the concept from trie and merge with json,
we can access the data with key address and using uniqueid in front the complete data to access it. 
for eg {"12":['b','a','123_t','124_h'],"13":['d','1230o']} where it stores values like bat,bath,
do and we can acess bat and bath from single value while saving space and have a mode of access. 
it will be userfull when handling big datas not for small ones.

in the above eg 123,124 are unique id and _ is a break point to sort out the data from id.

{
  "12": ['b','a','123_t','124_h'],
  "13": ['d','123_o']
}

ðŸ”¹ Prompt: Hybrid Trie-Like Key-Value Storage System
ðŸ”¹ Concept Overview
The goal is to create a memory-efficient data storage system inspired by Trie and JSON-like structures,
 optimized for handling large datasets. The system:

Uses key-value storage where the key acts as a base address.
Reduces memory usage by storing shared prefixes only once.
Uses a unique identifier (ID) per word for efficient retrieval.
Allows insertion, retrieval, deletion, and updates of words.
Supports saving/loading data in localStorage (Web) and JSON files (Native Devices).

ðŸ”¹ Data Structure Explanation
Data is stored in key-value format ({baseAddress: [values]}).
The baseAddress is derived from the first two letters of a word.
Each word gets a unique ID (id_) to differentiate entries.
Words sharing the same prefix are stored efficiently.

Feature	  | Description
Insertion	Adds a word to storage with a unique ID.
Retrieval	Fetches a word using base address + unique ID.
Update	    Modifies an existing word while keeping the same unique ID.
Deletion	Removes a word using its base address + unique ID.
Save/Load	Saves and retrieves data from localStorage (Web) or JSON files (Native Devices).
