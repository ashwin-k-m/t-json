something like this {'b':[{'a':[{'12_t':[{'121_h':[]},{'122_s':[]}]}]}]}

ðŸ”¹ This representation maintains a hierarchical structure, where:

Each character is a key in an object.
Instead of an array, an object or nested array holds words.
Unique IDs (12_t) identify words, and suffixes (121_h, 122_s) store variants like "hat" and "has".
ðŸ”¹ Benefits of This Approach
âœ… More hierarchical & closer to Trie.
âœ… Reduces redundancy by reusing common prefixes.
âœ… More structured retrieval.

ðŸ”¹ Comparison with Previous Method
Feature	          | JSON Trie ({ "ba": ["12_bat", "13_bath"] })	| Nested Trie ({ "b": [{ "a": [{ "12_t": ["121_h", "122_s"] }] }] })
Data Compression	Moderate (Base-addressed JSON)	              High (Strict prefix hierarchy)
Lookups	            Faster (Direct key lookup)	                  Slightly slower (Nested traversal)
Flexibility	        Can store varied words	                      Best for prefix-based words
Memory              Use	Efficient, but some redundancy	          Highly efficient (No duplicate storage)
